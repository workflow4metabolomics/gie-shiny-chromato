# TIC and BPC Chromatograms visualization (In Progress)

This repository makes possible to run a Shiny application in a Galaxy Interactive Environment to display TIC and BPC chromatograms from an RData file build by the package XCMS3.

## Context

* Based on the work of SÃ©bastien Hutinet with his [Shiny App](https://github.com/0driveshaft0/shiny_TIC_visualization).
* Using the [Docker Shiny Container](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/gie-shiny) to build Shiny GIE.
